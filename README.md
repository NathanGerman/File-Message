# File-Message

My name is Nathan and this is my very first file message code.

This code works with text files to store and retrieve messages. One part saves a message by writing it to a file. Another part adds a new message to the end of an existing file without deleting what is already there. The last part opens a file and reads everything inside it, returning an empty result if the file does not exist.
